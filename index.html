            testing made it apparent that this would not align with our app’s
            concept and value proposition. As users may be creating surplus
            foods just for recognition on the application rather than serving
            the main purpose which is food wastage prevention.  Additionally to
            this we thought it may be good to be able to pick who you're sending
            to and receive a nice message from the service user. However the
            user should not select based on a profile as this may cause
            prejudice bias. <br />The thank messages would be a great feature,
            but as some users may not have mobile phones it would be unfair to
            ask for this.<br

          >Working as a team and collaborating with each other taught us a
          lot.<br />Although it can be difficult at times because we all have
          different opinions, communicating with and listening to different
          points of view was a valuable learning experience.<br />We also
          discovered that UX writing and content strategy would be essential to
          the success of an app of this nature. When drafting the interview
          questions, we made an effort to practise these skills.<br /><br />One
          of the more crucial phases in the creation of an app is user testing,
          which realigns focus and prioritises the viewpoint of the user.<br /><br />From
          our research and collaborating together for our first group project it
          was great that things went well, but it was also positive having
          things go wrong. With conflicting ideas and collaborating struggles,
          we worked as a team to complete this project.<br />And finally, this
          was a fantastic experience even though during our research and
          collaboration we had faced some issues, which we overcame. With some
          of factors being conflicted with ideas and collaboration struggles,
          however this was all a learning curve that we all had to face working
          on this project and being able to succeed.<br /><br />I believe we
          have developed our skillset to be applied in UX/UI roles. These skills
          include: <br />Patience<br />Time management <br />Project management
          <br />Teamwork and Communication</span
